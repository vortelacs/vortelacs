ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Evghenii, a Computer Science Master's student at Aarhus University with a passion for software development.

ðŸŒŸ I've acquired hands-on proficiency in Java and Appium, where I enhanced my teamwork and honed my communication skills.

ðŸ’¼ During an internship, I worked with Java Spring, MySQL, Angular, and Docker, honing my skills in real projects and collaboration.

ðŸš€ Currently, I'm exploring Next.js with TypeScript and working on personal projects with Spring, MySQL, Next.js, and Docker.

ðŸ“§ I'm open to new opportunities and collaborations. Feel free to reach outâ€”I'd love to connect and discuss exciting prospects!
